# VUMeter
Vintage VU Meter

do not forget to copy CoreAudioApi.dll in the bin folder.  Remember this file should be with the VUMeter.exe file.  

Only these two files are enough to run ...

Left-Click & Drag everywhere in the window and drag it.
Resize it
Right-Click everywhere in the window to get the new audio output source, because when you change audio output source the default audio changes, the way to listen again is to right-click on the window, and everthing is OK!

To exit press Right-Click on the exit button at the right bottom corner, left button does not working because as said before left-click is for draging!
