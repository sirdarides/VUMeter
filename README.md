Left-Click everywhere in the window and drag it.

You can Resize it as you do with all windows.

When you change audio output source the default audio changes.  Right-Click everywhere in the window to get the new default audio output source.

To exit press Right-Click on the exit button at the right bottom corner, left button does not working because as said before left-click is for draging!

Do not forget to copy CoreAudioApi.dll in the bin folder.  Remember this file should be with the VUMeter.exe file.
